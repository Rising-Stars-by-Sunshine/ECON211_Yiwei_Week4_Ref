# Data
- The data shows the participant information and game-related variables from a session of a traveler's dilemma experiment. Each participant is identified by an ID, code, and label, with some indicating non-bot status. Other columns track their progression within pages, start time, visited pages, and unique identifiers like MTurk worker and assignment IDs. The session and its configuration details are recorded, including specific variables like BankA and BankB, potentially denoting monetary units. The traveler's dilemma game information is also structured, detailing players' IDs, roles, payoffs, claims, adjustments, and round numbers within groups. It appears to be a multi-round game where players make claims and adjustments related to the traveler's dilemma scenario, possibly influencing their payoffs based on their decisions and the group's dynamics.
